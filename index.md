## Welcome to our course on Answer set solving in practice!

Our course is usually held as a graduate course at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en)
but obvious circumstances made us produce an online version.
The schedule of the course follows roughly the material presented below and consists of two hours of lecture, two hours
of exercises, a tutorial, along with three practical assignments.

So this page will grow over winter and presumably change over time.
The raw material can be found in this
[github repository](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course).
The accompanying videos are provided through Potassco's
[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Potassco-live/videos).

Stay tuned and drop us an [email](mailto:torsten@cs.uni-potsdam.deleteme.de) for any comments!
